# RS-485 Hardware Test Configuration
#
# Copy this file to rs485-test-config.yaml and update with your machine details.
# The rs485-test-config.yaml file is gitignored for security.
#
# Test setup requires two machines connected via RS-485:
# - One machine acts as SENDER
# - One machine acts as RECEIVER
# - Or a single machine can act as BOTH (if using a loopback adapter)
#
# Note: baudRate, rs485Mode, and rs485ControlPin are NOT configured here.
# They are test parameters passed at runtime. See TestParams class.

# Path to the test application JAR (built with ./gradlew :hardware-test:testAppJar)
# The actual filename includes the version, e.g., rs485-test-app-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-all.jar
testJarPath: "hardware-test/build/libs"

# Remote working directory for test files
remoteWorkDir: "/tmp/rs485-test"

# Test timeout in seconds
